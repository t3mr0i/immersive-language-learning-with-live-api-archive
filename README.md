This is an interactive language learning application powered by the **Google Gemini Live SDK**. It simulates real-world roleplay scenarios (e.g., buying a bus ticket, ordering coffee) to help users practice speaking in various languages with an AI that adopts perfectly reactive personas.

## Featuress

- **Missions & Roleplay**: Chose from structured scenarios with specific objectives.
- **Learning Modes**:
  - **Teacher Mode**: Get helpful explanations and translations in your native language.
  - **Immersive Mode**: Strict "No Free Rides" policy where you must speak the target language to proceed.
- **Native Language Support**: Select your native language for tailored feedback and assistance.
- **Proactive AI Persona**: The AI adopts a specific role (e.g., "Bus Driver", "Friendly Neighbor"). And will only speak when necessary.
- **Real-time Multimodal Interaction**: Speak naturally with the AI, which responds with low-latency audio.
- **Performance Scoring**: Get graded on your fluency (Tiro, Proficiens, Peritus) with actionable feedback (Immersive Mode).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Vite, Web Audio API, WebSocket.
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, `google-genai` SDK.
- **Communication**: WebSocket for full-duplex audio streaming.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.10+)
- Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled.
- Google Cloud Application Default Credentials configured.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd immersive-language-learning-with-live-api
```

### 2. Quick Install

Run the installation script to set up both backend (Python venv) and frontend (Node modules) dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

### 3. Environment Config

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your Google Cloud details if necessary.

## Running the Application

### Development (Hot-Reload)

Start both the backend server and frontend development server with a single command:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

This will:

- Start the Python backend on port 8000.
- Start the Vite frontend dev server (usually port 5173).
- Enable `DEV_MODE` (bypassing Redis/ReCAPTCHA).
- Allow you to access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production Build

To serve the built frontend via the Python server:

1.  **Build**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Run Server**:
    ```bash
    python3 server/main.py
    ```
3.  Access at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 🚀 One-Click Production Deployment

The fastest way to get the app running in production is using Google Cloud Run:

1.  **Click the button below**:
 [![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=unpaidsoc&utm_campaign=FY-Q1-global-cloud-ai-starter-apps&utm_content=immergo-app&utm_term=-)   
2.  **Follow the prompts** in the Google Cloud Shell to authorize and deploy.

### 🛠 Manual Deployment (via `deploy.sh`)

If you prefer to deploy from your terminal, first create your own deployment script from the example:

```bash
cp scripts/example.deploy.sh scripts/deploy.sh
```

Edit `scripts/deploy.sh` with your project details, then run:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Advanced Configuration

To enable production features like metrics, bot protection, and scalable rate limiting, configure the following environment variables (defined in `server/simple_tracker.py` and `server/main.py`):

#### 1. BigQuery Metrics

To track session start and page view events in BigQuery:

- `BQ_DATASET`: Your BigQuery Dataset ID.
- `BQ_TABLE`: Your BigQuery Table ID.
- `DEMO_NAME`: (Optional) Name to identify this app in the metrics (default: `your-app-name`).

#### 2. reCAPTCHA v3

To protect against bots:

- `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`: Your Google reCAPTCHA v3 site key.
  - _Note: Ensure your Cloud Run URL is added to the allowed domains in the reCAPTCHA console._

#### 3. Redis (Rate Limiting)

For scalable rate limiting across multiple container instances:

- `REDIS_URL`: The URL of your Redis instance (e.g., `redis://10.0.0.1:6379/0`).
  - _Note: If using Memorystore for Redis, ensure your Cloud Run service is connected to the same VPC network._

## 🏃‍♂️ Get Started with Vibe-Coding in Google Antigravity

Build your own features, scenarios, or UI components in seconds using **Google Antigravity**. Whether you want to add a "Space Travel" mission or a new "Translator HUD," here is how to vibe-code your vision:

### 1. Open the Repository in Antigravity

Launch the workspace and point Antigravity to this folder. It will automatically ingest the `GEMINI.md` context file to understand the architecture.

### 2. Describe Your Vibe

Instead of writing boilerplate, just describe the feature you want.

- _"Add a new mission called 'Mars Colony Arrival' where the AI acts as a customs officer."_
- _"Make the splash screen heading pulse with a holographic glow."_
- _"Add a 'Voice Select' dropdown to the HUD so I can pick Gemini's personality."_

### 3. Iterate via Live Preview

Use the `./scripts/dev.sh` hot-reloading server. As Antigravity writes the code, you'll see the UI update instantly. Tell it to _"make the buttons more glassmorphic"_ or _"shift the layout down for better balance"_ until it feels just right.

### 4. Deploy Your Build

Once you're happy with your changes, use the **One-Click Deployment** or use Antigravity's terminal to run `./scripts/deploy.sh` to push your build directly to Google Cloud Run.

## 💰 Cost Analysis (Estimate)

> **NOTE:** Pricing based on the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Live API** costs as of **19th January 2026** (Source: [Google Cloud Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing)).
> _Disclaimer: Usage metadata currently does not discern between input and output tokens. For a conservative estimate, we assume all tokens are billed at the higher **output token** rate._

### Example Session: 1 Minute Conversation

**Context**: Teacher Mode (Audio + Transcript enabled), Duration **1:09**.

| Modality  | Token Count | Rate (Output)\* | Cost Estimate           |
| :-------- | :---------- | :-------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Audio** | 1,324       | $12.00 / 1M     | ~$0.0159                |
| **Text**  | 518         | $2.00 / 1M      | ~$0.0010                |
